## Goal: To decode the Genetic Landscape of Pancreatic Cancer and its Liver Metastases


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly metastatic disease refractory to all targeted and immune therapies. Here,
I present the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of synchronously resected PDAC primary tumors and matched liver metastases. I performed comparative
analysis on both cellular composition and functional phenotype between primary and metastatic tumors.
